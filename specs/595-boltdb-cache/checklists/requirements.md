# Specification Quality Checklist: Transition Persistent Cache to BoltDB

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec mentions "BoltDB" in the title and feature description as context from the issue, but all requirements and success criteria are technology-agnostic (single-file KV store, atomic writes, etc.).
- SC-001 specifies "under 5 milliseconds" which is measurable and verifiable via benchmarks.
- Migration (FR-010) uses SHOULD (not MUST) since cache is ephemeral data.
